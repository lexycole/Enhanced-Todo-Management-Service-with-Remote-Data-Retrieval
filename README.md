## ‚úçÔ∏è About 
This Angular App,  include a service to facilitates the management of todo items within the app. It fetches todo data from a remote API endpoint using HttpClient, ensuring seamless integration with external data sources. The service includes features such as filtering and mapping todo items based on specified criteria, optimizing data presentation and usability. By hydrating todo items with app-wide todo object types, the service enhances data consistency and compatibility across the application. Leveraging RxJS operators, such as switchMap and map, the service provides efficient data manipulation and retrieval, contributing to a smooth user experience.


## üó∫ Features
‚úîÔ∏è **Remote Data Retrieval:** The service retrieves todo items from a remote API endpoint using the HttpClient module, enabling seamless integration with external data sources.
‚úîÔ∏è **Data Hydration:** Each todo item fetched from the API is hydrated into the app-wide todo object type (`TODO`), ensuring consistency and compatibility with other parts of the application.
‚úîÔ∏è **Error Handling:** The service includes error handling logic to handle cases where fetching todos fails, providing a fallback mechanism to return a default todo item in such scenarios.
‚úîÔ∏è **Data Filtering and Mapping:** The service filters and maps the fetched todo items based on specified criteria, such as the number of todos to fetch (`config.todos.fetch.count`), optimizing data presentation and usability within the application.
‚úîÔ∏è **Efficient Data Manipulation:** Leveraging RxJS operators such as `switchMap` and `map`, the service efficiently manipulates and processes the fetched todo data, contributing to a smooth and responsive user experience.
